<h2>Phase unwrapping</h2>
<p>
Phase unwrapping is the step required in Fourier transform and phase 
shifting interferogram analysis to turn a wrapped phase map (one where
the phase angles have been collapsed into the range -pi..pi) into an
unwrapped phase map used to derive the wavefront map. Before
unwrapping, the phase map has jagged ridges and valleys, somewhat like
the surface of a Fresnel lens. Phase unwrapping effectively lifts and
lowers regions of the map to remove the discontinuities.
Unfortunately, many phase maps include spiral discontinuities that are
impossible to unwrap unambiguously. The best you can do is to unwrap
the clean portions of the phase map in a consistent way, and leave the
messy parts with ugly discontinuities.</p>
<p>
Phase unwrapping is used in many disciplines, most notably medical
imaging and synthetic aperture radar. In the application of medical
imaging, for example, it may be good enough to get a clear picture of
the less messy portions of the image. In optical interferometry,
large phase discontinuities probably invalidate the results. These
discontinuities are (by definition) a sudden multiple of 1 wavelength jump in height.
Defects this large will tend to swamp the analysis results. Small,
isolated discontinuities can probably be ignored. Long
discontinuities cannot.
<p>
<h2>Unwrap Errors</h2>



<p> You always need to assess whether your analysis results have
unwrap errors, and whether they are severe enough to invalidate the
results. Remember that each discontinuity is at least one wavelength
in height. Long discontinuities almost certainly invalidate your
results.</p>

<p>You can usually see the effect of unwrap errors in the contour and 3D plots.  You can see a detailed
view and count of the errors by using the View/show unwrap errors command.</p>


<p>If the errors enclose very small regions and are very hard w are not long  see on the view then you may be OK.  Many times you can never get them to zero but under few hundred may be OK.  Some are caused where the mirror is obscured for example, a center collimation target, bright reflections, or mirror stand safety latches. The ones that caues the most</p>

<p>On the other hand if there are long white lines or there are large circular regions then this could cause analysis errors.</p>

<p>One step you can try in DFTFringe is to
increase the size of the DC filter (the blue circle) used to clean the
background in vortex analysis. A larger circle filters more of the
background, and it may clean the phase map enough to proceed.</p>

<p> Failing the above step, all you can do is to try to take cleaner
interferograms. The fringes should be clean (not blurry), and
contrast should be good over the full interferogram. If possible
flares that obscure one or more fringes should be eliminated. In
general, the analysis works better with straighter
fringes.
