<p>Fourier Analysis is a technique to analyze interferograms that have their fringes much closer together than standard fringe tracing analysis.  It can extract higher resolution detail about the surface.  It also can add more noise to the analysis giving false bumps and dips, but if combined with many igrams taken at many mirror orientations it can give very good results.  It is usually quicker and more accurate to use FFT analysis as opposed to Fringe tracing analysis.</p>
